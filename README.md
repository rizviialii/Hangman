# Hangman
This is a hangman game made completly on Python as a side project to completely understand how conditions and loops really work. Rules are simple the program will pick a random word from the "Word.text" file and you'll have to guess the alphabets present in the randomly selected word by the program. If the played enter a wrong guess the number of tries will reduce by one. Once the tries are '0' the game will automatically end resulting in the player losing!, but if all the guesses made by the players are correct before running out of tried, it will result in player winning the game!
